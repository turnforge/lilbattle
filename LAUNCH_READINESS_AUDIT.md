## 1. Security & Authentication

### Completed ✅

**API Authentication** (PR #70)
- gRPC/Connect endpoints have authentication via metadata
- User ID passed from HTTP session to gRPC context
- Auth interceptors enabled in grpcserver.go
- Uses oneauth library for standardized auth handling

**Rate Limiting** (PR #70)
- Auth endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- IP-based limiting with proper headers

**Test Credentials Secured** (PR #70)
- Test auth conditional on `ENABLE_TEST_AUTH=true`
- User switching requires `ENABLE_SWITCH_AUTH=true`
- Auth disabled only with explicit `DISABLE_API_AUTH=true`

**Authorization Checks** (PR #72)
- Owner validation on UpdateGame/DeleteGame, UpdateWorld/DeleteWorld
- Player validation on ProcessMoves (must be game player AND current turn)
- Services: `services/authz/authz.go` with 17 unit test cases

**Security Headers** (PR #72)
- CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy
- Middleware: `web/server/securityheaders.go`

**OAuth Providers**
- Google, GitHub, Twitter/X (with PKCE)
- Session management via SCS library

### Remaining Security Items

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| P1 | Fix insecure gRPC connections (TLS) | 🟡 TODO |
| P1 | Input validation framework | 🟡 TODO |
| P2 | CSRF tokens on all forms | TODO |
| P2 | Audit logging | TODO |

## 2. Gameplay Features

### Complete ✅ (Production Ready)
- **Movement System**: Dijkstra pathfinding, 44 unit types, terrain costs
- **Combat System**: Probabilistic damage, 1.2MB authentic matrices, wound bonus, splash
- **Building Units**: Cost validation, terrain checks, shortcut generation
- **Capture System**: Multi-turn mechanic, ownership transfer
- **Healing System**: Terrain-based, unit-type restrictions
- **Fix/Repair System**: Adjacent friendly unit repair (4 test failures — see below)
- **Turn Management**: Player rotation, income generation, lazy top-up
- **Persistence**: File, PostgreSQL, Datastore backends
- **Replay/History**: Move groups, world changes, save/load
- **Unit Balance**: 44 types with authentic LilBattle data
- **Maps/Worlds**: Hex coords, 26 terrains, dynamic sizing
- **Multiplayer Infrastructure**: Sync broadcasting, transactions

### Known Issues

**Fix/Repair Tests Broken** — 4 tests fail in `lib/action_sequence_test.go`:
- `engineer_move_then_fix`, `support_move_then_fix`, `medic_move_then_fix`, `carrier_move_then_fix`
- Root cause: After moving from (0,0) to an adjacent tile, the friendly unit at (-1,0) is distance 2 from the new position, but fix requires adjacency.

**Victory Conditions** — Simplistic (last player with units wins). No alternate win conditions, elimination detection, or scoring.

**Damage Estimate** — Hardcoded at 50 in `game.go:755`. UI previews show incorrect values.

**AI Opponents** — Library exists in `.attic/lib/ai/` but not integrated with web UI.

---

## 5. Priority Recommendations

### P0 — Fix Now

1. **Fix the 4 failing tests** in `lib/action_sequence_test.go` (fix adjacency setup)
2. **Add `lib/` tests to CI** (blocked by item 1)
3. **Add TS tests to CI** (`cd web && pnpm test`)
4. **Add `services/authz/` and `web/server/` tests to CI**
5. **Victory condition tests** — a game without verified win conditions is incomplete
6. **Fix damage estimate** — hardcoded at 50 in `game.go`

### P1 — High Priority (Production Quality)

7. **Presenter SceneClicked tests** — main interaction path, zero coverage
8. **Movement terrain matrix** — table-driven tests for unit/terrain cost combinations
9. **Combat matchup matrix** — table-driven tests for attacker/defender/terrain damage
10. **Build eligibility matrix** — which units can be built at which bases
11. **Capture interruption** — capture broken by death or movement
12. **3+ player turn cycling and elimination**
13. **Pathfinding edge cases** — blocked paths, enemy blocking, narrow corridors

### P2 — Important (Robustness)

14. **Multiplayer sync integration test** — publish/receive/converge
15. **GORM backend tests** — production database layer untested
16. **Position parser unit tests** — all input formats
17. **CLI subcommand tests** — status, map, options output
18. **Splash damage variations** — friendly fire, multi-target, kill
19. **Seed determinism across save/load**
20. **Rate limiting verification**
21. **Input validation framework**

### P3 — Nice to Have

22. **Playwright e2e tests** — game creation, move, end turn, verify
23. **OAuth integration tests** with mocked providers
24. **Cache behavior tests** for backend service
25. **World editor e2e** — paint, save, reload
26. **Fix formula verification** — probabilistic correctness testing
27. **Session/password reset handler tests**
28. **API documentation** for developers
29. **FAQ/Help page** for users
30. **Browser-based game tutorial**

---

## 6. Testing Infrastructure

### 6.1 CI Coverage Gaps

The current CI command:
```
go test ./tests/... ./cmd/cli/... ./services/r2/... ./web/assets/themes/...
```

**Misses**:
- `./lib/...` (action sequence tests, rules loader)
- `./services/authz/...`
- `./web/server/...` (connect auth integration)
- TypeScript unit tests (`web/tests/`)

Proposed CI test command:
```
go test ./tests/... ./cmd/cli/... ./lib/... ./services/authz/... ./services/r2/... ./web/server/... ./web/assets/themes/...
cd web && pnpm test
```

Note: Adding `./lib/...` will make CI fail until the 4 fix tests are repaired.

### 6.2 Test Coverage Reporting

```
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./tests/... ./lib/... ./cmd/cli/...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1
```

### 6.3 GameBuilder Enhancements

The `GameBuilder` in `tests/game_builder.go` is solid. Suggested additions:
- `WithCrossing(fromQ, fromR, toQ, toR, terrainType)` for road/bridge tests
- `WithAllowedUnits(unitTypes...)` for build restriction tests
- `UnitDamaged(q, r, player, unitType, health)` shorthand for combat tests
- `MultiPlayer(n)` with auto-generated bases for N-player tests

### 6.4 Table-Driven Test Template

For game logic variable testing:
```go
func TestMovementCosts(t *testing.T) {
    cases := []struct {
        name     string
        unitType int32
        terrain  int32
        expected float64
    }{
        {"soldier on grass", UnitTypeSoldierBasic, lib.TileTypeGrass, 1.0},
        {"soldier on mountain", UnitTypeSoldierBasic, lib.TileTypeMountain, 2.0},
        {"tank on road", UnitTypeTank, TileTypeRoad, 0.5},
    }
    for _, tc := range cases {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // ... verify movement cost
        })
    }
}
```

### 6.5 Playwright E2E Setup

Create `web/playwright.config.ts` and initial smoke tests:
1. **Auth smoke**: Load login page, verify form renders
2. **Game creation smoke**: Login, create game, verify redirect to viewer
3. **Gameplay smoke**: Open game, click unit, see highlights, click to move
4. **World editor smoke**: Open editor, paint tile, save, reload, verify

## 8. Monetization

See [MONETIZATION.md](./MONETIZATION.md) for full strategy.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Footer banners, homepage ads, feature flags | ✅ Implemented |
| Phase 2 | Game end screen, turn transition ads | Planned |
| Phase 3 | Rewarded video ads | Planned |
| Phase 4 | Premium ad-free tier ($3-5/month) | Planned |

Phase 1 ad infrastructure (AdSlot component, AdScript loader, feature flags, CSP updates) is implemented. Google AdSense account setup still needed.

---

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Mitigated ✅
1. ~~Data Breach: API has no auth~~ → API authentication (#70)
2. ~~Authorization Bypass~~ → Authorization checks (#72)
3. ~~Data Loss: No backups~~ → Cloud storage with built-in redundancy
4. ~~Legal Liability: No LICENSE~~ → MIT License added
5. ~~Denial of Service~~ → Rate limiting (#70)
6. ~~Security Headers Missing~~ → Security headers middleware (#72)

### Medium Risk
1. **Test gaps in game logic** — combat matchups, terrain movement, victory conditions untested
2. **Fix/repair broken** — 4 failing tests, feature may be buggy in production
3. **Multiplayer untested** — sync flow has zero coverage
4. **Poor retention** — no tutorial, users may churn
5. **Damage estimates wrong** — hardcoded at 50

### Low Risk
1. AI not integrated but game works in hotseat mode
2. Simple win condition but functional
3. Missing API docs (internal-facing for now)
